When talking with others in English, never be afraid or shy to ask for
clarification if you don't understand what they said.  Here are a few {\em useful phrases} you can use: \\
{\scriptsize
\noindent
1 - Could you please say that [again, more slowly, in other words, in another way]. \\
2 - I'm sorry, I didn't [hear, understand, catch] that. Could you please [repeat, clarify, rephrase] it. \\
3 - What you just said isn't clear to me \\
e. Could you please go over it one more time? \\
4 - Would you please [explain, tell me] that again? \\
5 - I think I understand what you are saying. Can I repeat it back to you to make sure? \\
}

When using these phrases in conversation; straighten up, make eye contact, show sincerity, and speak slowly and clearly.
Asking for clarification is not something to be embarrassed about. It shows that you care, want to understand
